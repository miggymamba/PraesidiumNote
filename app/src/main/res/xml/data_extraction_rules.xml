    PraesidiumNote Backup Rules:
    I strictly excluded the security fallback preferences from Cloud Backup.

    Reasoning:
    1. Security: The 'installation_entropy_seed' is a device-specific secret.
       It should never leave the physical device's sandbox.
    2. Stability: Restoring this seed to a new device would decouple it from
       the local SQLCipher database (which might not be backed up), causing
       crypto-mismatches.
